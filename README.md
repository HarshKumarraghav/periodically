### [Periodically - The Periodic table](https://periodically.tech)

We all remember the times when we used to struggle to remember the names, properties, groups, etc. of periodic elements. Those sweet-saur nostalgic school memories of memorizing the whole periodic table for our upcoming Unit test used to be a nightmare for many of us! The periodic table is the heart of chemistry and to make its learning more fun and engaging, the idea to build **"Periodically-The Periodic Table"** was born.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Why a periodic table

In the **Periodically** web application you will find a huge amount of data about chemical elements for free. You will learn a lot of new and are useful for yourself, no matter if you are a schoolboy, student, engineer, housewife, or a person of any other provisions that do not have a refresher in Chemistry.

The chemistry falls into to a number of the most important sciences and is one of the main school objects.
Its studying begins with the Periodic Table. An interactive approach to a training material is more effective than a classical one. As in it
technologies which became the family for the modern pupils are used.

## üìå Description

**Periodically** - is a free web application that displays the entire Periodic Table at the startup interface. The table has a long-
form approved by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as the core. Besides the Periodic Table of
chemical elements, you can use the Table of solubility.

## ‚ú® Features

- Displays the entire Periodic Table at the startup interface.
- Thought of the day.
- When you click on any element provides information that is constantly updated.
- For most of the items have an image.
- For more information, there are direct links to Wikipedia for each item
- Table solubility
- To find any element you can use the search. The search engine is not choosy to the registry or writing style search.
- You can sort the items into 10 categories:
  ‚Ä¢ Alkaline earth metals
  ‚Ä¢ Other nonmetals
  Alkali metals
  ‚Ä¢ Halogens
  ‚Ä¢ Transition metals
  ‚Ä¢ Noble gases
  ‚Ä¢ Semiconductor
  ‚Ä¢ Lanthanides
  ‚Ä¢ Metalloids
  ‚Ä¢ Actinides
  Elements of the selected category will be listed in the search results and are highlighted in the table on the main application
  screen.
