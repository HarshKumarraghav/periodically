### [Periodically - The Periodic table](https://periodically.tech)

We all remember the times when we used to struggle to remember the names, properties, groups, etc. of periodic elements. Those sweet-saur nostalgic school memories of memorizing the whole periodic table for our upcoming Unit test used to be a nightmare for many of us! The periodic table is the heart of chemistry and to make its learning more fun and engaging, the idea to build **"Periodically-The Periodic Table"** was born.

## ⚛️ Why a periodic table

In the **Periodically** web application you will find a huge amount of data about chemical elements for free. You will learn a lot of new and be useful for yourself, no matter if you are a schoolboy, student, engineer, housewife, or a person of any other provision that does not have a refresher in Chemistry.

Chemistry falls into a number of the most important sciences and is one of the main school objects.
Its studying begins with the Periodic Table. An interactive approach to training material is more effective than a classical one. As in it
technologies that became the family for modern pupils are used.

## Periodically Demo


## 📌 Description

**Periodically** - is a free web application that displays the entire Periodic Table at the startup interface. The table has a long-
form approved by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as the core. Besides the Periodic Table of
chemical elements, you can use the Table of solubility.

## ✨ Features

- Displays the entire Periodic Table at the startup interface.
- Thought of the day.
- When you click on any element provides information that is constantly updated.
- For most of the items have an image.
- For more information, there are direct links to Wikipedia for each item
- Table solubility
- To find any element you can use the search. The search engine is not choosy to the registry or writing style search.
- You can sort the items into 10 categories:
  • Alkaline earth metals
  • Other nonmetals
  Alkali metals
  • Halogens
  • Transition metals
  • Noble gases
  • Semiconductor
  • Lanthanides
  • Metalloids
  • Actinides
  Elements of the selected category will be listed in the search results and are highlighted in the table on the main application
  screen.

## 🛠️ Periodically_golang_servers (API)

A simple Golang API for **Periodic Table Elements** returns in JSON format.
You can access the data by using this link:
