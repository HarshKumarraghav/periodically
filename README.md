<!-- ## 💥 Introduction

Crypto Cosmos is a web-based application that displays the latest updates about the top 100 cryptocurrencies like its current price, the percentage change in the last 24 hours, profit, etc. It also shows the behavior of any crypto in chart form, to make it more interactive. One can also search for any crypto and get information about a particular currency. Nice interactive graphs are there which will show you the growth/fall of the currency.

## 💡 Why did I build this?

The idea for this project was one of those startup ideas that I had a couple of months ago. When I landed in college in 2020, I and my friends were exploring various tracks. Investing in cryptocurrency was one of them. We have to monitor the behavior of each crypto and also on the market. Being students it was hard for us to invest this much amount of time on just one thing. That's when I decided to make a crypto tracker which will do all the heavy lifting for us and named my project "Crypto Cosmos".

## 🛠️ Tech used

It is built using **React JS**, **JavaScript**, **Material UI**, and **Chart JS** with full responsive functionality. I have used _Context API_ to manage the state of our app and **Coin Gecko API** to fetch all the information regarding the currencies. I also used **Particle-js** to give it a unique UI design.

# How to Contribute

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your operating system before you start contributing:

- [Nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

  To verify run:

  ```
  node -v
  ```

  ```
  npm -v
  ```

## Set up your Local Development Environment

Follow the following instructions to start contributing.

**1.** Fork [this](https://github.com/theplayer9/Crypto-Cosmos) repository.

**2.** Clone your forked copy of the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Crypto-Cosmos.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd Crypto-Cosmos
```

**4.** Add a reference(remote) to the original repository.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/theplayer9/Crypto-Cosmos.git
```

**5.** Check the remotes for this repository.

```
git remote -v
```

**6.** Always take a pull from the upstream repository to your master branch to keep it at par with the main project (updated repository).

```
  git pull upstream master
```

**7.** Create a new branch.

```
  git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
```

**8.** Install the dependencies for running the site.

```
  npm i
```

**9.** Make the desired changes.

**10.** Run the site locally to preview changes.

```
  npm start
```

**11.** Track your changes.

```
  git add .
```

**12.** Commit your changes. While contributing to this project, you can use signing-off-on-commits for each commit you make.

```
  git commit --signoff -m "<commit subject>"
```

or you could go with the shorter format for the same, as shown below.

```
  git commit -s -m "<commit subject>"
```

**13.** While you are working on your branch, other developers may update the `master` branch with their branch. This action means your branch is now out of date with the `master` branch and missing content. So to fetch the new changes, follow along:

```
  git checkout master
  git fetch origin master
  git merge upstream/master
  git push origin
```

Now you need to merge the `master` branch into your branch. This can be done in the following way:

```
  git checkout <your_branch_name>
  git merge master
```

**14.** Push the committed changes in your feature branch to your remote repo.

```
  git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
```

**15.** Once you’ve committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. Please ensure that you compare your feature branch to the desired branch of the repo you are supposed to make a PR to. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to GitHub. Your pull request will automatically track the changes in your development branch and update it.
